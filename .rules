# Repository Summary

## Executive Overview

Purpose
- Provide a Python package (src/python_mcp_server) for building an MCP-compliant server, accompanied by documentation, examples, and helper scripts to support adoption and operations.
Architecture
- Uses the 'src' layout: all library code resides under src/python_mcp_server, isolating imports and packaging from the repository root.
- Surrounding directories separate concerns: docs for written guidance, examples for runnable references, and scripts for development/ops tasks.
Major subsystems (inferred from structure)
- Core server runtime and lifecycle with protocol handling and request routing.
- Extension points for capabilities/resources/tools exposed to MCP clients.
- Configuration and startup utilities to compose and run a server.
Key patterns
- Clear separation between library code, documentation, and sample usage.
- 'src' layout packaging pattern for clean imports and distribution.
- Pluggable, modular design typical of server frameworks (specifics depend on package internals).
